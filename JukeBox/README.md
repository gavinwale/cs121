# Project #: Jukebox Hero

* Author: Gavin Wale
* Class: CS121 Section 4001
* Semester: Summer 2021

## Overview

The Jukebox Hero program reads in a user input .csv file containing various attributes of songs.
The list of songs can be printed, analyzed, and searched through.

## Reflection

This project was a great capstone of what I have learned thus far in the course and definitely pushed me
harder than any other project or activity has so far. I had to really dig deep to find examples and recall
information I forgot.

## Compiling and Using

Upon running, the console will prompt you with 5 options. In order to search, analyze, or print, you must load a valid
catalog first. Follow instructions and as you key into the console, press enter.
