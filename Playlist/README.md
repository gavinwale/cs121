# Project 1: PlayList

## Overview

PlayList.java uses the created Song object and methods to take user song input and output an analyzed playlist.

## Reflection

This project was definitely the most challenging school project I have had in computer science so far. I got stuck on so many parts and procrastinated until the last day so it was all on me to figure stuff out. I got it done to the best of my ability, but there are a few things I am not confident in.

I know there are definitely ways to do what I did much faster and more efficiently, but my program does print the expected output. When reusing variables from the first Song object, I kept them reinstantiated, and that got me stuck for over an hour for such an easy fix.

## Compiling and using
