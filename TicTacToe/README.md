# Project 5: Tic Tac Toe

* Author: Gavin Wale
* Class: CS121 Section 4001
* Semester: Summer 2021

## Overview

TicTacToeGame implements backend methods that allow the TicTacToeGUI to work properly. The game uses 1 and 2 dimensional arrays with loops and if-else statements for the logic.

## Reflection

This project was an amazing encapsulation of everything I have learned so far in this semester. I was happy that I was able to move quickly through the logic of the loops and if-else statements as well as pick up the concept of arrays quickly.

One part that was certainly challenging was figuring out how to make sure the player that went can't go again. I was kind of overcoding for the longest time until I finally tried something that worked. Another thing that was challenging at the start but got better as I got more stuff right was reading the tester. As my percent got higher I was able to sift through and find what I really needed to work on most.
