# Project #: 3 (LibraryOfBooks)

 * Author: Gavin Wale
 * Class: CS121 Section #4001
 * Semester: Summer 2021

## Overview

This program uses Book and Library classes that create objects that act like libraries
and books. The LibraryOfBooks file is a driver that uses these classes to create a user
interface in order to navigate the library.

## Reflection

This project was extremely time consuming especially because most of the time I was not 
entirely focused while working. Usually I was really tired or busy with other things. The
past couple of days I decided it was best to take the time to apply myself completely when
the time came around and it helped, but it was still very time consuming.

I was able to write the driver class quickly and easily, but the Library class took forever,
and it took even longer trying to get it into the driver class. I enjoyed the challenge,
but I did not have the time or effort in me to complete everything perfectly. Every time I solved one problem, another one came up.

## Compiling and Using

When run, the program will display a user interface with a simple menu of options. For each
option you select, the console will execute the command or prompt you for more user input. Follow
the prompts that appear in the console and it should be really simple to use.
